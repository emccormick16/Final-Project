picnic.py is the game that works, picnic2.py has syntax errors that I could not figure out.
My game is a word puzzle game. You are going on a picnic and need to bring items on the picnic. However, there are certain rules to what can and cannot be brought. You have to figure out what items are allowed by guessing, and hopefully, figuring out the rule. The rule is that whatever you bring must start with a vowel. You can bring an apple, but you cannot bring a pear.
I tried to incorporate a 5 guess limit, but could not figure out how to do it (which is what the picnic2.py file is). I had an issue with using the range function inside of the def function. An issue that I was able to figure out was slicing the input and determining whether or not that was a vowel. I was stuck on this issue for a while but it ended up being an easier solution that I had imagined. Overall, this was a difficult game for me to create, but it was rewarding once I figured out the syntax that was wrong.
